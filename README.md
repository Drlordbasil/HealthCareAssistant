# Healthcare AI - Free Healthcare Assistance

This is a Python project designed to provide free healthcare assistance to Americans. The project utilizes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to facilitate the process of finding doctors, scheduling appointments, and prescribing medication.

## Business Plan

### Objective

The objective of this project is to provide free healthcare assistance to Americans by utilizing AI technology. The project aims to address the issue of limited access to healthcare services and aims to make healthcare more accessible to individuals who may not have the means to afford medical assistance.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this project is individuals in the United States who are in need of healthcare services but may not have access to them due to financial constraints. This includes individuals who are uninsured or underinsured.

### Benefits

The benefits of this project include:

1. **Cost Savings**: By providing free healthcare assistance, individuals can avoid expensive medical bills and reduce their financial burden.
2. **Improved Access**: The AI system makes it easier to find doctors and schedule appointments, increasing accessibility to healthcare services.
3. **Convenience**: Users can schedule appointments and receive prescriptions online, saving time and effort.
4. **Quality Healthcare**: The project ensures that patients receive medical care from qualified doctors in various specialties.

### Revenue Model

The project operates on a non-profit basis and does not generate revenue directly. Funding is obtained through donations, sponsorships, and grants. Partnerships with healthcare organizations and government agencies can also provide additional support for the project.

## Python Code Explanation

The provided Python code implements the healthcare AI system. It includes the following classes:

- `Person`: A base class representing a person with attributes such as name, age, gender, address, and contact details.
- `Patient`: A subclass of `Person` representing a patient with additional attributes specific to patients.
- `Doctor`: A subclass of `Person` representing a doctor with an additional attribute for their specialty.
- `Appointment`: A class representing an appointment between a patient and a doctor, including the date and time of the appointment.
- `Prescription`: A class representing a prescription issued by a doctor to a patient, including medication details and instructions.
- `HealthAI`: The main class that handles the AI system, including finding doctors by specialty, scheduling appointments, and prescribing medication.

The `main()` function demonstrates the usage of the AI system by creating dummy data and showcasing the functionality for scheduling appointments and prescribing medication.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd healthcare-ai`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main script: `python main.py`

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or above installed on your system.

## Usage

To use the healthcare AI system:

1. Instantiate the `HealthAI` class with a list of available `Doctor` instances.
2. Use the `schedule_appointment()` method to schedule appointments for patients by providing the patient details, date, time, and specialty.
3. The method will return an `Appointment` instance if a doctor is available for the requested specialty, otherwise it will return `None`.
4. Use the `prescribe_medication()` method to generate a prescription by providing the doctor, patient, medication, dosage, and instructions.
5. The method will return a `Prescription` instance.

You can modify the dummy data in the `main()` function to add or change doctors and patients as needed.
